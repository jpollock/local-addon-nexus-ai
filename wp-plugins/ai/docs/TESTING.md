# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing philosophy and strategy for the AI Experiments plugin, adhering to the "pyramid way of testing" to ensure comprehensive coverage and maintainability.

---

## Testing Philosophy

**Principle**: Test behavior, not implementation. Focus on what users experience.

**Pyramid Structure**:
- **70% Unit Tests**: Fast, isolated logic testing
- **25% Integration Tests**: WordPress + Plugin interactions
- **5% E2E Tests**: Real user workflows

---

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests (Logic Layer)

**Purpose**: Test pure functions and business logic in isolation, without loading the WordPress environment.

**Location**: `tests/Unit/`

**Example Test Suite**: `tests/Unit/Includes/FeatureCollectionTest.php`

```php
class FeatureCollectionTest extends TestCase {

    /**
     * Test that a feature can be registered.
     */
    public function test_register_feature() {
        $collection = new Feature_Collection();
        $feature    = new Mock_Feature( 'test-feature' );

        $this->assertTrue( $collection->register_feature( $feature ) );
        $this->assertTrue( $collection->has_feature( 'test-feature' ) );
    }

    // ... other unit tests for Feature_Collection ...
}
```

### 2. Integration Tests (WordPress + Plugin Interactions)

**Purpose**: Test interactions between different parts of the plugin, and between the plugin and WordPress core, database, or other plugin components. These tests run within a WordPress test environment.

**Location**: `tests/Integration/`

**Example Test Suite**: `tests/Integration/Includes/Feature_RegistryTest.php`

```php
class Feature_Registry_Test extends WP_UnitTestCase {

    /**
     * Test that registry returns singleton.
     */
    public function test_instance_returns_singleton() {
        $instance1 = Feature_Registry::instance();
        $instance2 = Feature_Registry::instance();

        $this->assertSame( $instance1, $instance2, 'Feature_Registry should return the same singleton instance' );
    }

    // ... other integration tests for Feature_Registry ...
}
```

### 3. Edge Cases and Error Scenarios

While specific examples are provided in the "Post Duplication Feature" strategy, for our plugin, we would focus on:

*   **Data Integrity**: Ensuring data is handled correctly (e.g., special characters, large data sets).
*   **Performance**: Testing for memory limits and execution time for critical operations.
*   **Security**: Verifying permission checks and input sanitization.
*   **WordPress Integration**: Ensuring correct interaction with WordPress APIs (actions, filters, post types, etc.).
*   **Third-Party Compatibility**: If applicable, testing interactions with other plugins (e.g., WooCommerce, ACF).

## Test Execution Strategy

### Local Development

```bash
# Run all tests
composer test

# Run static analysis (fast, focuses on type safety)
composer stan

# Run only unit tests (fast - run frequently)
vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite "AI Plugin Unit Tests"

# Run only integration tests (slower - run before commit)
vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite "AI Plugin Integration Tests"
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

Automated testing in a CI/CD pipeline would involve running both unit and integration tests on every push and pull request, potentially across a matrix of PHP and WordPress versions.

---

## Coverage Targets

**Quality Gates**:
- **Unit tests**: Aim for 90%+ code coverage for pure logic.
- **Integration tests**: Aim for 80%+ critical path coverage.

---

## Summary

By adhering to this testing strategy, we ensure that the AI Plugin is robust, reliable, and maintainable, with a clear focus on testing behavior and user experience.
